    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have always loved contributing back to the developer community in any
way I can. And that&rsquo;s why I spend so much time open-sourcing projects,
organizing developer conferences &amp; hackathons, writing blog posts and
even answering questions on StackOverflow.</p>

<p>This week I got a pleasant surprise when I noticed that I gained the
highest possible privilege level on the site (i.e. access to private
Stackoverflow analytics), after crossing <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1533054/sheharyar">25,000 in reputation
points</a>.</p>

<p>Yep, you read that right! 25,000 points! With over 55+ questions, 180+
answers, 3500+ votes cast, 100+ edits and a reach of over 1.5 million
people, it took me a long time getting here since I first created my
profile back in July 2012. (Admittedly, I tried to game the system in
the beginning, but was quickly caught and reprimanded – I&rsquo;ve since
focused on only asking questions for things I didn&rsquo;t know, and answering
them for which I did). Nothing says happiness like Fake Internet Points™;
just look at this glorius graph showing my journey on the StackExchange
network:</p>

<p>As a side note, I&rsquo;m also currently fluctuating around the 10th position
in the <a href="http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/370021/top-100-users-from-pakistan">Top 100 users from Pakistan</a> list on StackExchange Data.
I hope that I would continue helping developers out in the future, using
amazing platforms like StackOverflow!</p>
