    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few days back, I gave a talk to a relatively non-technical audience on the topic of
Remote Access Trojans, to help them better understand some of the serious security and
privacy threats out there. I decided to go with RATs because of their serious exploitative
nature and the relatable consequences of being lax with the security of your personal
systems.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve intentionally left a lot of topics out of the presentation and casually mentioned
or ignored some things that would outrage security professionals. If you feel the same
way while going through the presentation, then this is clearly not for you. I&rsquo;ve tried
my best to convey these concepts in simple manner and demo it along with it, while being
simply a computer security enthusiast.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past 8+ months, I&rsquo;ve been tinkering with the <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir Programming Language</a>
and the <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix Framework</a>. This was my first experience with a &ldquo;real&rdquo; functional
language and I learned a lot about the paradigm and the ecosystem.</p>

<p>Last week, I had a chance to share my thoughts and experiences with other developers
at the <a href="http://isloojs.com/">Islamabad.js</a> meetup. You can check out the slides below:</p>

<p>I still don&rsquo;t consider myself a great elixir developer, much less an expert and still
have a long way to go, but Saša Jurić&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action">Elixir in Action</a> and Josh Adam&rsquo;s
<a href="http://elixirsips.com/">ElixirSips</a> were extremely helpful resources to get me here. Do check them out!</p>
