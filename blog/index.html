      <p>If you live in Pakistan, you know how common Internet Censorship is here (and to some extent, I&rsquo;m okay with that &ndash; &lsquo;Porn Sites&rsquo;) but
banning YouTube? Seriously guys. And it&rsquo;s been quite a while since it was blocked. The real reason it was blocked was because of a
blasphemous video called &lt;Don&rsquo;t Even Remember the Name> being posted somewhere on it. Pakistanis, or should I say Muslims, take that
very seriously. But the Pakistani Government didn&rsquo;t do what the rest of the Muslim world did, that is blocked the video, instead they
simply blocked all of Youtube. Pakistanis have been using Spotflux, HideMyAss, Hotspot Shield and God-Knows-What other Proxy programs
to get access to Youtube; We <strong><em>are</em></strong> a little frustrated (Well, not me &ndash; I&rsquo;ve been using Tor long before for everything).</p>

<!--more-->




<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/87489847" width="750" height="422" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>But last week that video was finally taken down, but the Pakistani Government still refuses to lift the ban on  Youtube. To fight the evil
Pakistani Government Dragon, rose the Rapping Warrior, Ali Gul Pir, with the mighty sword of #KholoBC. He released his video &ldquo;Kholo
Ban Chor&rdquo; on Youtube and Vimeo and within days gained tens of thousands of views despite censorship. This video has inspired somewhat of
a &ldquo;Youtube Unblocking Revolution&rdquo; causing thousands of Internet Users from Pakistan to start using the #KholoBC Hashtag on Social Media
Websites to demand the lift on the ban.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/21198/kholo-bc-and-eight-other-reasons-to-lift-the-ban-on-youtube-now/">The Tribune</a> points out:</p>

<blockquote><p>The ban has never been about protecting the honour of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh),
come to think about it. Its real purpose seems to be a calculated halt,
so that the activities of our unscrupulous leaders are not exposed.</p></blockquote>

<p>and that seems to be the very point of the video.</p>

<h2>NOTE:</h2>

<p>I want to clarify that I have high regards for the Holy Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and I, like millions of other Muslims, cannot bear any
blasphemous act in his honour. But shutting down the entire website seems inappropriate since it&rsquo;s a source of education as well and
has helped so many people learn something new. The right way is simply to block the specific pages, like the rest of the world is doing.</p>

    <div class="post_content">
      <p>I recently came across this nifty little terminal app called <a href="https://whatbox.ca/wiki/tsocks">TSocks</a> that allows you to use a Socks Proxy
for your terminal commands. I already use <a href="http://torproject.org/">Tor</a> for all other web communications on my Macbook Air, so I wanted to
be able to use Tor for my terminal commands as well. You can download and install it via <a href="http://sonnykt.tumblr.com/post/1256048245/using-terminal-commands-with-socks-proxy">MacPorts</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/11870#issuecomment-12080107">Homebrew</a> or you can build it manually. Sadly, the TSocks Project
is no longer maintained. So I set out to find a recent fork or a modified version that would work, and after 10 minutes into my quest I found
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/torsocks/">TorSocks</a>. It was a customized version of TSocks, specfically built to work with Tor out of the box and since
Tor was the real reason I wanted to use TSocks in the first place, this was perfect for me. I didn&rsquo;t need to customize anything, I just
installed it and started using it.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>You can install TorSocks via <a href="http://superuser.com/a/641732/214953">MacPorts</a> but I personally like to use <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ brew install tor            # required depencency
</span><span class='line'>$ brew install torsocks
</span><span class='line'>$ brew install wget</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Usage is fairly simple. First start Tor using the commandline or the Vidalia GUI, then use either <code>torsocks</code> or <code>usewithtor</code> commands to
execute any other command that connects to the internet. One thing that pisses me off is that the <code>ping</code> command doesn&rsquo;t work with it.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ usewithtor wget google.com</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You&rsquo;ll see that the file will be downloaded. Not Satisfied? You can check your IP using the following commands:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ curl ipecho.net/plain             # Your Original IP
</span><span class='line'>$ torsocks curl ipecho.net/plain    # Your IP over Tor</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

      <p>I came across this blog today, called <a href="http://ogchronic.wordpress.com/">How not to be a Pakistani</a>, and I can&rsquo;t believe how perfectly the author describes some of the things of our Pakistani Culture.</p>

<p>A few posts that gave me a good laugh (and made me think) were <a href="http://ogchronic.wordpress.com/2014/01/28/how-to-be-a-social-cheetah/">How to be a Social Cheetah</a> and <a href="http://ogchronic.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/how-to-be-an-average-pakistani-chawal/">How to be an average Pakistani &lsquo;Chawal&rsquo;</a>, especially the second one. It made me doubt myself a little. This is <strong>exactly</strong> how things are here and I don&rsquo;t want to be a part of it.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go into any more details, but you should definitely check the blog out!</p>

      <p>Last time <a href="http://sheharyar.me/blog/ubuntu-13-10-parallels-monitor-configuration-crtc-80/">I mentioned</a> that I was working on a new Hobby Project, <a href="http://pupil-labs.com/pupil/">Pupil</a>. This was my first time working with Python and OpenCV for that matter.</p>

<p>This project was already getting on my nerves. So many errors, before I even had the chance to touch the code. One error that was driving me nuts was:</p>

<p>I googled high and low, looked at the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pupil-discuss">Pupil Google Group</a>, opened up <a href="https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil/issues/4">Github Issues</a>. I was the only one getting this error, but why? I had followed the <a href="https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil/wiki/Dependencies-Installation-Linux">Installation Guide</a> closely, and on three different clean installations of Ubuntu. This was really frustrating.</p>

<p>In the end, it was a friend on Facebook who told me to try working after installing <code>openexr</code>. I did, and problem solved. <code>libIlmImf.so.6</code> is a package bundled with it.</p>

<p>Anyways, you can do this to make the error go away:</p>

      <p>Last night I spent hours configuring Ubuntu and Installing Dependencies, programs and God-knows-what for a new Hobby Project of mine, <a href="http://pupil-labs.com/pupil/">Pupil</a>.</p>

<p>It was a clean installation of Ubuntu 13.10 in Parallels 9 on my new Macbook. I had invested too much time installing pupil, only to find that the display drivers or GTK or something had been corrupted. This was the second time I was booting ubuntu and had been slapped in the face by this:</p>

</span><span class='line'>could not set the configuration for CRTC 80</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>image</strong></p>

<p>I restarted it, but received the same error. The login screen was perfect, mind you; The error presented it self only after logging in. There was nothing else; No Icons, no Menu bar, no Unity. I googled for hours and tried everything I could; <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1835391">Using xrandr</a>, <a href="http://kb.parallels.com/en/114097">Editing xorg.conf</a>, <a href="http://www.parallels.com/support/desktop/troubleshooter-en_US">Running Parallels Troubleshooter</a> and so much more. In the end, I was somewhat able to restore my installation by reinstalling my Parallels Desktop Tools.</p>

<p>These are the exact steps I followed after logging in:</p>

<ol>
<li>Press <code>Control + Alt + F1</code></li>
<li>In the full-screen terminal, login with your credentials</li>
<li>In the Parallels Desktop Menu, select <em>Devices > CD/DVD 1 > Connect Image</em></li>
<li>In the new Finder dialog, browse to <em>Applications > Parallels Desktop > Contents > Resources > Tools > pri-tools-lin.iso</em></li>
<li>Now back in your terminal screen, type the following commands:</li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sudo mkdir /media/cdrom
</span><span class='line'>sudo mount /dev/sr0 /media/cdrom
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd</span> /media/cdrom
</span><span class='line'>sudo ./install
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Parallels Tools&#8217; installation will begin. Go through the steps and complete the installation. After that, reboot using: <code>$ sudo reboot</code></p>

<p>If everything went fine, you would at least be able to see your desktop. In my case, there was no Unity Sidebar or the top Menu Bar; But it&rsquo;s still something. Maybe installing Gnome would help.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Make regular <em>Snapshots</em> of your OSes in Parallels</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m a recent Mac convert so it was really weird for me when I realized that hitting the Return key in Finder renames the file instead of opening it. I&rsquo;ve spent the better part of my life using Windows and Linux and as you can imagine this was really frustrating for me (and still is).</p>

<p>After a bit of Googling, I found out that you can open selected files in Finder using the <code>⌘ + O</code> combination on your keyboard. I&rsquo;m still trying to find a way to modify this to the &lsquo;Return&rsquo; key to have a consistent <em>Keyboard experience</em> on all my PCs.</p>

      <p>No. This isn&rsquo;t another rant by a new Rubyist about how Ruby is so beautiful, open and awesome &amp; how <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> has liberated yet another slave of <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>. I love Ruby, Rails, Octopress and other <em>Hip</em> Geeky things; but I love Wordpress too. Moving to Octopress is somthing I have been wanting to do for a long time. I wanted to have complete control over my writings. I wanted them to be as minimal as possible, both in terms of design and code.</p>

<p><strong>Let me stop you right there.</strong> Octopress is not for you. You&rsquo;ll have to write in Markdown, there&rsquo;s zero community support compared to wordpress, you have to write and deploy from possibly only one system and you&rsquo;ll have to get your hands dirty. Real Dirty. Getting hard? Well, I am. My condition is something like <a href="http://billpatrianakos.me/blog/2012/10/31/the-making-of-an-octopress-theme/">Bill Patrianakos</a> tells it:</p>

<blockquote><p>There’s something about static files, Markdown, Git repos, the terminal, and a text editor that turns me on.</p></blockquote>

<p>Octopress is really cool. This might be my first public post on the platform, but I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with Octopress for months on my local system. The Sass, the Liquid Engine and other fine grains of the platform made me fall in love. But the theme &ndash; It was overly complicated and too much used on the web. I wanted it to be a little different and hence I decided to launch an Octopress Blog only when I have made my own Octopress theme.</p>

<p>Thus born was <code>Sybtle</code>, an Octopress theme created from scratch and inspired by the <a href="https://svbtle.com">Svbtle</a> online writing platform. I might release it in the future, but for now if you want to use it, you&rsquo;ll have to go through the <a href="https://github.com/sheharyarn/sheharyarn.github.io">code</a> yourself and clean it up.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s enough rant for today.</p>
