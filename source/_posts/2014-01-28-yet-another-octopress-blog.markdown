No. This isn't another rant by a new Rubyist about how Ruby is so beautiful, open and awesome & how [Octopress](http://octopress.org) has liberated yet another slave of [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org). I love Ruby, Rails, Octopress and other *Hip* Geeky things; but I love Wordpress too. Moving to Octopress is somthing I have been wanting to do for a long time. I wanted to have complete control over my writings. I wanted them to be as minimal as possible, both in terms of design and code.

**Let me stop you right there.** Octopress is not for you. You'll have to write in Markdown, there's zero community support compared to wordpress, you have to write and deploy from possibly only one system and you'll have to get your hands dirty. Real Dirty. Getting hard? Well, I am. My condition is something like [Bill Patrianakos](http://billpatrianakos.me/blog/2012/10/31/the-making-of-an-octopress-theme/) tells it:

>Thereâ€™s something about static files, Markdown, Git repos, the terminal, and a text editor that turns me on.

Octopress is really cool. This might be my first public post on the platform, but I've been experimenting with Octopress for months on my local system. The Sass, the Liquid Engine and other fine grains of the platform made me fall in love. But the theme - It was overly complicated and too much used on the web. I wanted it to be a little different and hence I decided to launch an Octopress Blog only when I have made my own Octopress theme.

Thus born was `Sybtle`, an Octopress theme created from scratch and inspired by the [Svbtle](https://svbtle.com) online writing platform. I might release it in the future, but for now if you want to use it, you'll have to go through the [code](https://github.com/sheharyarn/sheharyarn.github.io) yourself and clean it up.

That's enough rant for today.
