I'm a recent Mac convert so it was really weird for me when I realized that hitting the Return key in Finder renames the file instead of opening it. I've spent the better part of my life using Windows and Linux and as you can imagine this was really frustrating for me (and still is).

After a bit of Googling, I found out that you can open selected files in Finder using the `âŒ˜ + O` combination on your keyboard. I'm still trying to find a way to modify this to the 'Return' key to have a consistent *Keyboard experience* on all my PCs.

Anyways, digging my new Macbook Air. :D
